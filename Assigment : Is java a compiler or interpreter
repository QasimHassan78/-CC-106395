## Question : Is Java a compiler or interpreter ##
Answer :Java is both Interpreted and Compiled.
Many languages, such as Java, are both compiled and interpreted to take advantage of the current benefits of compilers. The Java code is compiled into the Object Code itself.
At runtime, the JVM interprets the object code into the intended device's machine code.
